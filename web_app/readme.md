# Presence-Only Geographical Priors for Fine-Grained Image Classification - Web Viewer
Web-app to display predictions of our spatio-temporal model.   
1) Train your own model, or download the pretrained model from [here](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/omacaod/projects/geopriors/model_inat_2018_full_final.pth.tar). 
2) Make sure the path to the trained model in `config.py` is correct.  
3) `application.py` assumes that the code for the model is in the parent directory.  

### Demo
If successful you can open your browser and see the following.

## Deploy Locally
Run `python application.py`  


## Deploy on AWS
Have at least t2.small instance.    
Make sure ports are open on AWS (in security groups).  

Use nginx to divert traffic from port 80.

	}
}
```

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com  
sudo service nginx restart  


#### Launch app
screen gunicorn application:application  


## Deploy - AWS Elastic Beanstalk  
As of Mar 2019 I was having trouble installing PyTorch on elastic beanstalk. Maybe it's better now?
